# Advent-of-Code-2019
My solutions to the Advent of Code 2019 - https://adventofcode.com/2019

Advent of Code is a fun daily challenge running from December 1st through to Christmas Day. Each day there are two parts to the challenge to complete with the fastest 100 correct answers gaining points towards an overall leaderboard. It is great fun to participate as the challenges get more difficult as the month goes on and can be completed using any coding language. I have chosen to use python this year as it is my first language and I want to see the variety of challenges I can meet using it.
