My solutions to the Advent of Code 2019 - https://adventofcode.com/2019

Advent of Code is a fun daily challenge running from December 1st through to Christmas Day. Each day there are two parts to the challenge to complete with the fastest 100 correct answers gaining points towards an overall leaderboard. It is great fun to participate as the challenges get more difficult as the month goes on.
